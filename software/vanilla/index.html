<p><b><i><a name="s1">Overview:</a></i></b>

<p>Vanilla is a collection of command line programs written in Java to
access some selected features in PAL, a 
Java library for molecular evolution and phylogenetics
(see <a href="http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/pal-project/">http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/pal-project/</a>
for details on PAL). 
<em>Note that Vanilla does not provide all functionality
available in  PAL.</em>  

<p><font size ="-1" color="brown">
In fact, for the vast majority of things you still need to
program yourself!  In that respect, this package
is provided in the hope that it may serve as a
useful guide and introduction to learn how to use PAL in your own programs.
</font>
<p>
Vanilla 1.2 is only a minor
update from Vanilla 1.1 to accommodate the changes from PAL 1.1 to PAL 1.2.    
It runs best in a shell environment
(Unix, Windows, MacOS X) and requires Java 1.1 or better
(see <a href="#s3">Download and Installation</a> section).


<p>Vanilla includes programs to compute maximum-likelihood distances
for nucleotides and amino acid data, to estimate of maximum-likelihood branch lengths
on trees (incl. clock trees and dated tips), for statistical 
(e.g., Shimodaira-Hasegawa) and topological (Robinson-Foulds) comparison of trees, to infer demographic
parameters from trees (based on the coalescent), and also utility programs
to reformat and modify alignments.

<p><b><i><a name="s2">Applications:</a></i></b>
<p>Vanilla applications offer plain and simple text-only interfaces and
are intended to be run in a shell environment.  Be warned - there
is no graphical user interface,  Vanilla is definitely not Mac/Windows-like.
<p><i>Applications with a PHYLIP-style character user interface (self-explanatory
menus):</i>

<ul>

<li>
<b>MLDIST:</b></li>

and in incorporating rate variation over sites
<font size="-1">(uniform rate or discrete Gamma model)</font>.
MLDIST also computes observed distances
and can obtain approximate estimates of unknown model parameters, e.g,
the Ts/Tv ratio. The default file name for the sequences is "indata"
<font size="-1">(PHYLIP or CLUSTAL W format)</font>.
<p>

<li>

models (see MLDIST). The likelihood can be computed using the user-provided
branch lengths or, alternatively, branch lengths can be optimized as well
<font size=-1>(for
unconstrained trees, clock trees, and clock trees with dated tips)</font>.
If more than one tree is present in an "intree" file the trees can be statistically
compared
<font size=-1>(using the Kishino-Hasegawa, Shimadoira-Hasegawa,
and expected Akaike weights)</font>. Note, however, that MLTREE presently
does not do any tree searches.

<i>Applications with a command line interface</i>:
<p>To get a list of available options simply call the program without any
parameter. On a Macintosh you will be asked to enter the command line
parameters.
<ul>
<p>

<li>
<b>TREECOMP:</b></li>

<pre>Usage: treecomp intree1 intree2</pre>
Reads two trees, each from a different file, and computes the 
Robinson Foulds score (topological distance measure based
on splits).  If the two trees are identical a score of zero
is returned.
<p>

<li>
<b>DEMOGRAPH:</b></li>

<pre>Usage: demograph intree [epsilon] outfile</pre>
Estimates demographic parameters (effective population size, growth rate)
by maximizing the coalescent prior for a single given clocklike tree.
Also computes the classic skyline plot, a non-parametric estimate of population size
through time (O. G. Pybus et al.  2000. Genetics 155:1429-1437), and its extension,
the generalized skyline plot (K. Strimmer and O. G. Pybus. 2001. Submitted).
Epsilon is the smoothing parameter of the generalized skyline plot.
<p>

<li>
<b>CONCAT:</b></li>

<pre>Usage: concat infile1 infile2 .. outfile</pre>
Concatenates a set of sequence alignments.
<p>

<li>
<b>SHOWTREE:</b></li>

<pre>Usage: showtree treefile [outfile]</pre>
Reads treefile (NH format), generates ASCII picture, and computes distance
matrix induced by branch length. If no outfile is specified the ASCII picture
of the tree is printed to stdout.
<p>

<li>
<b>REROOT:</b></li>

<pre>Usage: reroot node treefile outfile</pre>
Reads a treefile (NH format) and reroots the tree, making node the new
root.
<p><li>
<b>SPLITCODON:</b></li>

<pre>Usage: splitcodon infile outfile</pre>
Separate 1st, 2nd, 3rd codon positions of an alignment into separate file.
<br> 
<br> </ul>
At the command line <b>all applications must be called in lower case and
prefixed by "v_"</b> (v_mldist, v_showtree, etc.).  Note that the "v_"
is not part of the "official" name of a program, rather is makes installation
and deinstallation more convenient.

<p>Hint: In many shell environments typing "v_" followed by a tab will
provide you with a list of all Vanilla applications.
<br> 
<p><b><i><a name="s3">Download and Installation:</a></i></b>
<p>Vanilla requires Java 1.1 (or better).
 <b>It is strongly recommended to install a Java Virtual Machine with a JIT ("just in time")
compiler.</b>  On Linux installation of
<a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun Java 1.3 for Linux</a> is recommend because it includes
a very fast runtime system (based on a so-called hot-spot compiler).
On the Macintosh please install a recent version of the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/java">Macintosh Runtime for Java (MRJ)</a>.
However, probably the best way to run Vanilla on a Mac is to install MacOS X and then
install the UNIX version.

<p>This version of Vanilla relies on <a href="http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/pal-project/">PAL
1.2</a>. PAL is (c) 1999-2001 by the PAL Core Development Team and is licensed
under the
<a href="license.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Sources
and documentation for PAL are separately available from the PAL web page
at
<a href="http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/pal-project/">http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/pal-project/</a>.
<p>Note that a Java <i>compiler</i> and download of PAL sources is not
necessary as the Vanilla package already contains all necessary classes
in precompiled form.
<p>
Vanilla 1.2 is distributed in two variants (for convenience only, functionality and sources
are 100% identical across platforms):
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://strimmerlab.org/software/vanilla/vanilla-1.2.tar.gz">vanilla-1.2.tar.gz</a> (Unix)
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://strimmerlab.org/software/vanilla/vanilla-1.2.zip">vanilla-1.2.zip</a> (Windows)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Due to the arrival of Mac OS X (=Unix), a separate Macintosh version is no longer supported.
<p>
After uncompressing using appropriate tools 
the following simple directory structure will be created on all platforms:
<pre>
                 vanilla-1.2
              _______|______ _____ ______ __________
             |              |     |      |          |                
            bin           data   doc   classes     src        
         ____|____                       |          
        |    |    |                 vanilla.zip   
      unix  win  mac                   pal.zip
</pre>
The "bin" folder contains the Vanilla "binaries", i.e. shell scripts (Unix), batch files
(Windows) or JBindary files (Macintosh, no longer supported). The "data" directory contains some example
data sets. The "doc" folder contains this page and some other documentation.
The "classes" folder contains the precompiled Java class files for Vanilla
and for PAL, and the "src" folder contains the Vanilla source code.
<p>To be able to run the Vanilla programs the system needs to be told where
the binaries and the Java bytecode sit on the hard drive. On Unix and
Windows this is done by setting the PATH and CLASSPATH variables appropriately,
on a Mac the Java classes need to be put in a special directory.
In doubt please ask your local Unix/Windows/Mac expert for help:
<ul>
<li>
Unix (edit files .login, .cshrc, .bashrc):</li>
<br><tt>%csh</tt>
<br><tt>setenv VDIR $HOME/vanilla-1.2</tt>
<br><tt>setenv PATH $VDIR/bin/unix:$PATH</tt>
<br><tt>setenv CLASSPATH $VDIR/classes/vanilla.zip:$VDIR/classes/pal.zip:$CLASSPATH</tt>
<p><tt>%sh, bash</tt>
<br><tt>VDIR=$HOME/vanilla-1.2</tt>
<br><tt>export PATH=$VDIR/bin/unix:$PATH</tt>
<br><tt>export CLASSPATH=$VDIR/classes/vanilla.zip:$VDIR/classes/pal.zip:$CLASSPATH</tt>
<br> 
<p><li>
Windows (edit autoexec.bat):</li>

<br><tt>PATH C:\VANILLA-1.2\BIN\WIN</tt>
<br><tt>set CLASSPATH=C:\VANILLA-1.2\CLASSES\VANILLA.ZIP;C:\VANILLA-1.2\CLASSES\PAL.ZIP</tt>
<br>
<p><li>
Macintosh:</li>
<br>
Move the files vanilla.zip and  pal.zip from the "classes" folder (in the
Vanilla directory) into the 
"MRJ Classes" folder which sits in the "MRJ Libraries" directory
which itself is located in the extensions folder of
the System folder. 
</ul>
The actual sequence of commands necessary for Unix and Windows will depend on the location of
the Vanilla package on your hard disk and whether other programs make use
of the PATH and CLASSPATH variables.

<p>Vanilla can also be compiled
into native code (as can PAL) using the GNU gcj compiler, makefiles are
included with the distributions of both Vanilla and PAL.
