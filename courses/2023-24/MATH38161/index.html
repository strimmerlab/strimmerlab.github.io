<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH38161 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH38161/index.html">introductory course in Multivariate Statistics and Machine Learning</a> for third year mathematics students. This module provides an <b>introduction to classical multivariate statistics</b> (multivariate random variables and distributions, transformations, dimension reduction methods such as PCA and CCA, multivariate dependence measures, multivariate mixture models) and also offers a <b>primer to machine learning</b> (unsupervised learning and clustering, supervised learning and classification, EM algorithm). At the end of this module there is a brief outlook to modern nonlinear and nonparametric machine learning methods (e.g. random forests, Gaussian processes, neural networks).</p>

<p>The modules is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks in six parts, each covering a particular aspect of multivariate statistics and machine learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Multivariate random variables and estimation in large and small sample settings (W1 and W2)</li>
<li>    Transformations and dimension reduction (W3 and W4)</li>
<li>    Unsupervised learning/clustering (W5 and W7)</li>
<li>    Supervised learning/classification (W8 and W9)</li>
<li>    Measuring and modelling multivariate dependencies (W10)</li>
<li>    Nonlinear and nonparametric models (W11, W12)</li>
</ol>

<p>The presentation of the material focuses on concepts and methods, not on theory.  The practical implementation and application in R is another priority in this module.
The example sheets contain both computational and programming problems as well as theoretical problems.
</p>


<p><strong>Teaching Format:</strong></p>


<p>This course is <b>taught in traditional format</b> with 2 lectures and 1 tutorial per week. </p>

<p> <b>The main reference in this course are the <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH38161/index.html">MATH38161 lecture notes</a></b> and you are
expected to revisit the content of the lectures 
each week using these notes.  The weekly learning plan available on Blackboard  indicates which parts of the notes are relevant in each study week.</p>

<p>In the <b>weekly tutorials</b> the problems in worksheets are discussed. <b>You are expected to attempt the problems within the week before the tutorials.</b> Often this will involve some bits of programming and data analysis on the computer.  You are welcome to work together in a group to solve the problems.</p>

<p>The teaching style follows a traditional "non-flipped" format. Hence, you don't need to study the content before coming to the lectures. However, it is <b>essential to revisit the material of each week before the next lectures</b> and also <b>solve the corresponding example sheet</b> so that you don't fall behind and continue to be able to follow the subsequent lectures.</p>



<p>All lectures (but not the tutorials!) will be recorded automatically and corresponding
podcasts will appear on the <a href="https://video.manchester.ac.uk">UoM video portal</a> within 24 hours of the event.

<p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>

<p>There is one in-semester take-home assessment worth 20%. This is small project requiring data analysis in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> 
and writing of a corresponding statistical report, preferably in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>. </p>
<p>
The end-of-semester assessment is worth the remaining 80% and is concerned with theory and methods. This exam will take place on campus in Manchester on 22 January 2023.</p>
