<p>Academic tutorial leads: K. Strimmer, tbd.

<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH27720 Statistics 2 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH27720-stats2/index.html">introductory course in likelihood and Bayes inference</a>
for second year mathematics students. 
In this module, you will explore the foundations of statistical learning through likelihood and Bayesian approaches, as well as understand how these methods are grounded in the concept of entropy.</p>

<p>The module is designed to run over the course of 10 weeks 
and has the following structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Entropy and likelihood (W1–W5)</li>
<li>    Bayesian statistics (W6–W10)</li>
</ol>


<p>
The course presentation emphasises concepts and methods, aiming to provide insights into how various statistical approaches are interconnected. It seeks to illustrate that statistics presents a clear and cohesive theory of information, countering the common misconception that it is merely an ad hoc collection of "recipes" for data analysis.
</p>


<p><strong>Teaching Format:</strong></p>


<p>This course is fully in person with <b>3 contact hours</b> per week over 10 weeks - either 3 lectures (odd weeks) or 2 lectures and 1 tutorial (even weeks). The <b>lectures take place on tbd</b>, and <b>tutorials on tbd</b>. </p>

<p>The <b>delivery mode</b> of this module is <b>traditional using the visualiser</b> for presenting the content. It is advised to take your own notes during the lectures.</p>



<p> <b>The main reference in this course are the 
<a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH27720-stats2/index.html">MATH27720 Statistics 2 lecture notes</a></b> and you are
expected to revisit the content of the lectures 
each week using these notes.  The weekly learning plan available on <a href="https://canvas.manchester.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>  indicates which parts of the notes are relevant in each study week. </p>

<p>
In the <b>biweekly tutorials</b> the problems in worksheets are discussed. You are expected to attempt at least some of the problems before the tutorials. 
You are welcome to work together in a group to solve the problems. Solutions will
be provided after the last tutorial has completed.</p>

<p>All lectures (but not the tutorials!) will be recorded automatically and corresponding
podcasts will appear on the <a href="https://video.manchester.ac.uk">UoM video portal</a> within 24 hours of each session.

<p>There are no tutorials in Week 12. Tutorials are not recorded.  If you have any questions
about the content of the course then attending the tutorials is your best opportunity to 
get those questions answered in person.</p>




<p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>

<p>The in-semester assessment for Statistics 2 (midterm test) is worth 10% of the overall
mark for MATH27720 and is taken on campus 
in a computer lab.
The end-of-semester assessment for Statistics 2 (half of the written MATH27720 exam) is worth 40% and is taken on campus.</p>

<p>Note that Semester 1 (Probability 2) and Semester 2 (Statistics 2) each contribute 50%
of the total available marks for MATH27720.  Half of the written exam will be about Statistics 2
and the other half about Probability 2.</p>
