<p><strong>Expectations:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Questions and feedback:</em>
This is a course with 400 students. Any questions you may have about the content of the module must be asked in person in the live sessions (5 tutorials).  Due to the sheer size of the class tuition by email is not practical.
</li>
<li><em>Example sheets and learning plan</em>: It is important that you do not fall behind with learning.  Follow closely the weekly learning plan, read and study all recommended materials and prepare questions in advance to be answered by  in the tutorials. Try to solve the exercises every week by yourself or in a study group. </li>
<li><em>Review lectures, not traditional lectures</em>: The course follows the principle of "flipped learning".  This means that the lectures on Monday afternoon are not traditional lectures but have the function to highlight the key aspects of the material that you are expected to have studied beforehand! Hence, studying the lecture notes
and the other provided materials is essential.
</li>
</ol>

 
<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH20802 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH20802/index.html">introductory course in statistical methods</a> for second year mathematics students. It is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks and has four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Revisiting essentials  (W1)</li>
<li>    Likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests (W2–W5)</li>
<li>    Bayesian learning and inference (W6–W8)</li>
<li>    Linear regression models (W9–W11)</li>
</ol>

<p>This module focuses on conceptual understanding and methods, not on theory, As such, the presentation in this course is non-technical. The aim is to offer insights how diverse statistical approaches are linked and to demonstrate that statistics offers a concise and coherent theory of information rather than being an adhoc collection of “recipes” for data analysis (a common but wrong perception of statistics).
</p>

<p><strong>Flipped classroom:</strong></p>



<p>The course is taught based on the principle of "flipped learning":</p>
<ul>
<li>
 First,
guided by the weekly learning plan the material is studied asynchroneously from lecture notes and lecture videos and by attempting questions
and problems on the corresponding worksheets.  </li>
<li>Subsequently,
in  synchroneous live review sessions the new material of each week is recapitulated and in live tutorials the
tasks given the worksheets are discussed in an interactive fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Frequently asked questions and comments:</strong></p>


 <p>
I hope you enjoy the course! If you have any questions, comments, or corrections please
contact the lecturer.
First <b>check 
the <a href="math20802-faq.txt">MATH20802 FAQ</a> 
whether your question has already been asked and answered before!</b>
 </p>



<p id="covid19"><strong>COVID-19 safety guidelines:</strong></p>

<p>
<b>Wearing a face mask is mandatory (not optional) when attending MATH20802!</b> 
This is a very large class, with no possibility for distancing in a crowded lecture hall.  
Among the 400 students in this class there will inevitably be many with weak health
(e.g. cancer, immunocompromised students due to medication, with weak response to vaccination etc.).  It is those vulnerable students we need to protect by mask wearing.
Therefore, unless you have an exemption issued by the
<a href="http://www.occhealth.manchester.ac.uk/">UoM Occupational Health Service</a>
<b>you must wear a mask in the lecture hall and the other teaching spaces! </b> 
</p>


<p>
We have a collective responsibility to follow safety measures and advice to reduce the risk to ourselves and others. Below are some measures that we can take to play our part - see also the <a href="https://www.welcome.manchester.ac.uk/get-ready/health-wellbeing-safety/">welcome information on health, well-being and safety</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Staff and students attending campus are encouraged to <b>carry out lateral flow tests twice a week</b>, and to <b>get vaccinated</b>. Check the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/covid-19-testing/">details of walk-in vaccination clinics on campus and where to collect free rapid lateral flow testing kits on campus</a>. </li>
<li><b>If you have symptoms or have contact with someone who tests positive, you must NOT come to campus.</b> Please follow the guidance on testing, self-isolation, and reporting below:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/covid-19-testing/">University advice on testing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/self-isolation/">University advice for self-isolating students</a></li>
<li>If you test positive for Covid-19 or if you are isolating/quarantining but have no positive test <a href="https://www.qualtrics.manchester.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_ero5ZwsafR9UW90">please use this form to report to  the University</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Please <b>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</b>. Hand sanitising points can be found at various points throughout University buildings -- please look out for these and use them!</li>

<li><b>Help reduce crowding</b> and keep buildings flowing safely by:
<ul>
<li>arriving to the lecture theatre/classroom no earlier than 5 minutes before the start time, and</li>
<li>departing the lecture theatre/classroom no later than 10 minutes before start of the next session.</li>
</ul>
