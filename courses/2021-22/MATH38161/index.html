<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH38161 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH38161/index.html">introductory course in Multivariate Statistics and Machine Learning</a> for third year mathematics students. It is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks in six parts, each covering a particular aspect of multivariate statistics and machine learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Multivariate random variables and estimation in large and small sample settings (W1 and W2)</li>
<li>    Transformations and dimension reduction (W3 and W4)</li>
<li>    Unsupervised learning/clustering (W5 and W7)</li>
<li>    Supervised learning/classification (W8 and W9)</li>
<li>    Measuring and modelling multivariate dependencies (W10)</li>
<li>    Nonlinear and nonparametric models (W11, W12)</li>
</ol>

<p>The presentation of the material focuses on concepts and methods. In the worksheets the
 practical implementation and application in R is explored.
</p>


<p><strong>Flipped classroom:</strong></p>



<p>The course is taught based on the principle of "flipped learning":</p>
<ul>
<li>
 First,
guided by the weekly learning plan
the material is studied asynchroneously from lecture notes and lecture videos and by attempting questions
and problems on the corresponding worksheets.  </li>
<li>Subsequently,
in  synchroneous live review sessions the new material of each week is recapitulated and in live tutorials the
tasks given the worksheets are discussed in an interactive fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p>The live teaching sessions take place on campus and also simultaneously broadcasted via Zoom (access details are published on <a href="https://online.manchester.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>).</p>

<p>All sessions will be recorded automatically and corresponding
podcasts will appear on the <a href="https://video.manchester.ac.uk">UoM video portal</a> within 24 hours of the event ending.

<p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>

<p>There is one in-semester assessment worth 20%. This is a small project requiring data analysis in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> 
and writing of a corresponding statistical report, preferably in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>. </p>
<p>
The end-of-semester assessment is worth the remaining 80% and is concerned with theory and methods. It will be a 100% take home exam.</p>

<li><b>If you have symptoms or have contact with someone who tests positive, you must NOT come to campus.</b> Please follow the guidance on testing, self-isolation, and reporting below:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/covid-19-testing/">University advice on testing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/self-isolation/">University advice for self-isolating students</a></li>
<li>If you test positive for Covid-19 or if you are isolating/quarantining but have no positive test <a href="https://www.qualtrics.manchester.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_ero5ZwsafR9UW90">please use this form to report to  the University</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Please <b>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</b>. Hand sanitising points can be found at various points throughout University buildings -- please look out for these and use them!</li>

<li><b>It is expected that face coverings will be worn in lecture theatres and teaching spaces.</b> Unless you are exempt, when on campus please wear a face covering when moving around indoors and attending classes. Face coverings will be available at the main entrances of all campus buildings. I will be wearing a face covering in class, and encourage each of you to do the same unless you are exempt.</li>

<li><b>Help reduce crowding</b> and keep buildings flowing safely by:
<ul>
<li>arriving to the lecture theatre/classroom no earlier than 5 minutes before the start time, and</li>
<li>departing the lecture theatre/classroom no later than 10 minutes before start of the next session.</li>
