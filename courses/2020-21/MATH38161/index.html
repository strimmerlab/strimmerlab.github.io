<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH38161 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH38161/index.html">introductory course in Multivariate Statistics and Machine Learning</a> for third year mathematics students. It is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks in six parts, each covering a particular aspect of multivariate statistics and machine learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Multivariate random variables and estimation in large and small sample settings (W1 and W2)</li>
<li>    Transformations and dimension reduction (W3 and W4)</li>
<li>    Unsupervised learning/clustering (W5 and W6)</li>
<li>    Supervised learning/classification (W7 and W8)</li>
<li>    Measuring and modelling multivariate dependencies (W9)</li>
<li>    Nonlinear and nonparametric models (W10, W11)</li>
</ol>

<p>The presentation of the material focuses on concepts and methods. In the worksheets the
 practical implementation and application in R of the methods is explored.
</p>

<p><strong>Flipped classroom:</strong></p>



<p>The course is taught based on the principle of "flipped learning":</p>
<ul>
<li>
 First,
guided by the weekly learning plan
the material is studied asynchroneously from lecture notes and lecture videos and by attempting questions
and problems on the corresponding worksheets.  </li>
<li>Subsequently,
in  synchroneous live review sessions the new material of each week is recapitulated and in live tutorials the
tasks given the worksheets are discussed in an interactive fashion.</li>
</ul>

Note that due to the <a href="https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/news/display/?id=25224">new national restriction in the UK from 5 November 2020</a> the course is now taking place fully online, rather than in a blended fashion as initially intended (with some sessions from Tutorial group 1 taking place on campus).

<p>
The third online live session (Thursday tutorial) is delivered via <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>.  The corresponding meeting ID and password is shown on <a href="http://online.manchester.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>.</p>

<p>Recordings of the review lectures are available on <a href="http://online.manchester.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>. The tutorial sessions are not recorded.</p>




<p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>

<p>There is one in-semester assessment worth 20%. This is a small project requiring data analysis in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> 
and writing of a corresponding statistical report, preferably in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>. </p>
<p>
The end-of-semester assessment is worth the remaining 80% and is concerned with theory and methods. It will be a 100% take home exam.</p>
