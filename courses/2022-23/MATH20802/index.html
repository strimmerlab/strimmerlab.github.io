<p><strong>Teaching format and expectations:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li><em>Traditional lecture format</em>: In the academic year 2022/23 this course is taught in traditional format with 2 lectures and 1 tutorial per week.
There is no need to watch any videos before coming to the lectures, and you also don't need to study the content before attending the lectures.
</li>

<li><em>Reference text and learning plan</em>:
The main reference in this course are the <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH20802/index.html">MATH20802 lecture notes</a>. You are
expected to revisit the content of the lectures 
each week using these notes so that you don't fall behind and continue to be able to follow the lectures of the next week.
The weekly learning plan available on Blackboard  indicates which parts of the notes are relevant in each study week.

</li>
<li><em>Example sheets</em>: It is important that you attempt to solve the exercises
every week by yourself or in a study group before the weekly tutorial. If you encounter any problems prepare questions in advance to be answered in the tutorials by the tutors.</li>

<li><em>Questions:</em>
Any questions you may have about the content of the module must be asked in person in the tutorials. Please direct any question about the tutorials to the tutor in your MATH208082 tutorial (i.e. not to the main lecturers).  Note that this is a course with about 400 students so tuition by email cannot be offered.
 The office hour of the lectures are not to be used as replacements for attending the tutorials.
</li>


</ol>

 
<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH20802 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH20802/index.html">introductory course in statistical methods</a> for second year mathematics students. In this module you will learn about the foundations of statistical learning using likelihood and Bayesian approaches and also how these methods are underpinned by entropy.   This module focuses on conceptual understanding and also provides examples in R.</p>

<p>It is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks and has four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Revisiting essentials  (W1)</li>
<li>    Likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests (W2–W5)</li>
<li>    Bayesian learning and inference (W6–W8)</li>
<li>    Linear regression models (W9–W11)</li>
</ol>

<p>The presentation in this course is non-technical. The aim is to offer insights how diverse statistical approaches are linked and to demonstrate that statistics offers a concise and coherent theory of information rather than being an adhoc collection of “recipes” for data analysis (a common but wrong perception of statistics).

<p><strong>Frequently asked questions and comments:</strong></p>


 <p>
I hope you enjoy the course! If you have any questions, comments, or corrections please
contact the lecturer.
First <b>check 
the <a href="math20802-faq.txt">MATH20802 FAQ</a> 
whether your question has already been asked and answered before!</b>
 </p>



<p id="covid19"><strong>COVID-19 safety guidelines:</strong></p>

<p>
We have a collective responsibility to follow safety measures and advice to reduce the risk to ourselves and others. Below are some measures that we can take to play our part - see also the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/coronavirus-faqs/">University info page on "Coronavirus: Frequently asked questions"</a>.
</p>



<ol>

<li>
<b>We advise anyone who has <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/">COVID symptoms</a> or tests positive to stay at home</b> and to avoid contact with other people until you feel well enough to resume normal activities and no longer have a high temperature. Please check the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/">current NHS guidance</a> for further details.</li>

<li>You should continue to <b>report a positive COVID-19 test result to the University</b> as this enables us to monitor infection rates within our University community and will help us to make timely decisions in case of local outbreaks. 
 </li>

<li>We encourage all students (if possible) to <b>get vaccinated</b> with an approved COVID-19 vaccine, along with any boosters.</li>

<li><b>Face coverings are provided at main building entrances for people to wear in lecture theatres and teaching spaces.</b>  
Wearing a face covering is strongly recommended when you will be in close contact with other people, such as in crowded and enclosed spaces, and when there are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating, such as in winter or when COVID-19 rates are high.
See the government guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-safely-with-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19#when-to-consider-wearing-a-face-covering-or-a-face-mask">"Living safely with respiratory infections, including COVID-19"</a>. 
</li>

<li><b>Help reduce crowding</b> and keep buildings flowing safely by:
<ul>
<li>arriving to the lecture theatre/classroom no earlier than 5 minutes before the start time, and</li>
<li>departing the lecture theatre/classroom no later than 10 minutes before start of the next session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
