<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH20802 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH20802/index.html">introductory course in statistical methods</a> for second year mathematics students. In this module you will learn about the foundations of statistical learning using likelihood and Bayesian approaches and also how these methods are underpinned by entropy.   This module focuses on conceptual understanding and also provides examples in R.</p>

<p>It is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks and has four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Likelihood estimation and inference (W1–W4)</li>
<li>    Bayesian learning and inference (W5–W8)</li>
<li>    Linear regression models (W9–W11)</li>
</ol>

<p>The presentation in this course is non-technical. The aim is to offer insights how diverse statistical approaches are linked and to demonstrate that statistics offers a concise and coherent theory of information rather than being an adhoc collection of “recipes” for data analysis (a common but wrong perception of statistics).

on campus.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching format and expectations:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li><em>Traditional lecture format</em>: In the academic year 2022/23 this course is taught in traditional format with 2 lectures and 1 tutorial per week.
There is no need to watch any videos before coming to the lectures, and you also don't need to study the content before attending the lectures. However, it is <b>essential to study the material of each week within the week before the next lectures and also to solve the corresponding example sheet</b> so that you don't fall behind and continue to be able to follow the subsequent lectures.
</li>

<li><em>Reference text and learning plan</em>:
<b>The main reference in this course are the <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH20802/index.html">MATH20802 lecture notes</a>.</b> You are
expected to revisit the content of the lectures 
each week using these notes.
The weekly learning plan available on Blackboard  indicates which parts of the notes are relevant in each study week.

</li>

<li><em>Example sheets</em>: <b>You are expected to attempt the problems within the week before the tutorials.</b>
This will allow you to prepare questions in advance to be answered in the tutorials by the tutors.
You are welcome to work together in a group to solve the questions on the worksheet.
</li>

<li><em>Asking questions:</em>
<b>In the weekly tutorials we are more than happy to answer in person any questions you may have about the content of the module.</b>    The weekly office hours of the lecturers are offered to help with issues that cannot be discussed in public. Due to the size of the class (350-400 students) individual tuition by email is not possible.
Therefore, if you have any questions and would like to get them answered the best way is to attend the tutorials.
</li>

<li><em>Student-led study groups</em>:   In addition to the tutorials we encourage students to meet and study together in small study groups.  If you would like to set up your own study group please let us know and we will get you in touch with other interested students.
</li>

We have a collective responsibility to to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses to ourselves and others. Below are some measures that we can take to play our part - see also the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/coronavirus-faqs/">University info page on "Coronavirus: Frequently asked questions"</a>.
</p>



<ol>

<li>
<b>We strongly advise anyone who has <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/">COVID symptoms</a> or tests positive to stay at home</b> and to avoid contact with other people until your symptoms clear and you no longer test positive using a rapid lateral flow test. Please check the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/">current NHS guidance</a> for further details.</li>

<li>We encourage everyone (if possible) to <b>get vaccinated</b> with an approved COVID-19 vaccine,  and to <b>keep vaccinations current</b>.</li>

<li>Wearing a face covering is highly recommended when there are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating and you are in close contact with other people in crowded and enclosed spaces (such as lecture theatres and teaching spaces). <b>Face masks are provided for free at main building entrances.</b></li>

<li><b>Help reduce crowding</b> and keep buildings flowing safely by:
<ul>
<li>arriving to the lecture theatre/classroom no earlier than 5 minutes before the start time, and</li>
<li>departing the lecture theatre/classroom no later than 10 minutes before start of the next session.</li>
