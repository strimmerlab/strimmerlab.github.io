<p><strong>Overview and syllabus:</strong></p>

<p>The MATH38161 module is an <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH38161/index.html">introductory course in Multivariate Statistics and Machine Learning</a> for third year mathematics students. This module provides an introduction to classical multivariate statistics (multivariate random variables and distributions, transformations, dimension reduction methods such as PCA and CCA, multivariate dependence measures, multivariate mixture models) and also offers a primer to machine learning (unsupervised learning and clustering, supervised learning and classification, EM algorithm). At the end of this module there is a brief outlook to modern nonlinear and nonparametric machine learning methods (e.g. random forests, Gaussian processes, neural networks).</p>

<p>The modules is designed to run over the course of 11 weeks in six parts, each covering a particular aspect of multivariate statistics and machine learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Multivariate random variables and estimation in large and small sample settings (W1 and W2)</li>
<li>    Transformations and dimension reduction (W3 and W4)</li>
<li>    Unsupervised learning/clustering (W5 and W7)</li>
<li>    Supervised learning/classification (W8 and W9)</li>
<li>    Measuring and modelling multivariate dependencies (W10)</li>
<li>    Nonlinear and nonparametric models (W11, W12)</li>
</ol>

<p>The presentation of the material focuses on concepts and methods, not on theory.  The practical implementation and application in R is another priority in this module.
The example sheets contain both computational and programming problems as well as theoretical problems.
</p>


<p><strong>Teaching Format:</strong></p>


<p>In the academic year 2022/23 this course is taught in traditional format with 2 lectures and 1 tutorial per week. </p>

<p> The main reference in this course are the <a href="../../../publications/lecture-notes/MATH38161/index.html">MATH38161 lecture notes</a> and you are
expected to revisit the content of the lectures 
each week using these notes.  The weekly learning plan available on Blackboard  indicates which parts of the notes are relevant in each study week.</p>

<p>In the weekly tutorials the problems in worksheets are discussed. Your are expected to attempt the problems in the week before the tutorials. Often this will involve some bits of programming and data analysis on the computer.</p>

<p>Note that contrast to previous (pandemic) versions of the module in this year
the format is "non-flipped" again: there is no need to watch any videos before coming to the lectures, and you also don't need to study the content before the lectures. However, it is essential to study the material of each week after the lectures so that you don't fall behind and continue to be able to follow the lectures of the following week.</p>


<p>All lectures (but not the tutorials!) will be recorded automatically and corresponding
podcasts will appear on the <a href="https://video.manchester.ac.uk">UoM video portal</a> within 24 hours of the event.

<p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>

<p>There is one in-semester take-home assessment worth 20%. This is small project requiring data analysis in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> 
and writing of a corresponding statistical report, preferably in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>. </p>
<p>
The end-of-semester assessment is worth the remaining 80% and is concerned with theory and methods. This exam will take place on campus in Manchester in January 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Frequently asked questions and comments:</strong></p>


 <p>
I hope you enjoy the course! If you have any questions, comments, or corrections please
contact the lecturer.
First <b>check

<p id="covid19"><strong>COVID-19 safety guidelines:</strong></p>

<p>
We have a collective responsibility to follow safety measures and advice to reduce the risk to ourselves and others. Below are some measures that we can take to play our part - see also the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus/support-current-students/coronavirus-faqs/">University info page on "Coronavirus: Frequently asked questions"</a>.
</p>



<ol>

<li>
<b>We advise anyone who has <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/">COVID symptoms</a> or tests positive to stay at home</b> and to avoid contact with other people until you feel well enough to resume normal activities and no longer have a high temperature. Please check the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/">current NHS guidance</a> for further details.</li>

<li>You should continue to <b>report a positive COVID-19 test result to the University</b> as this enables us to monitor infection rates within our University community and will help us to make timely decisions in case of local outbreaks. 
 </li>

<li>We encourage all students (if possible) to <b>get vaccinated</b> with an approved COVID-19 vaccine, along with any boosters.</li>

<li><b>Face coverings are provided at main building entrances for people to wear in lecture theatres and teaching spaces.</b>  
Wearing a face covering is strongly recommended when you will be in close contact with other people, such as in crowded and enclosed spaces, and when there are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating, such as in winter or when COVID-19 rates are high.
See the government guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-safely-with-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19#when-to-consider-wearing-a-face-covering-or-a-face-mask">"Living safely with respiratory infections, including COVID-19"</a>. 
</li>

<li><b>Help reduce crowding</b> and keep buildings flowing safely by:
<ul>
<li>arriving to the lecture theatre/classroom no earlier than 5 minutes before the start time, and</li>
<li>departing the lecture theatre/classroom no later than 10 minutes before start of the next session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
